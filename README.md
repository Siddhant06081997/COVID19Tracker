# COVID-19_TRACKER_HTML_CSS_JAVASCRIPT
COVID-19 with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript


This is a single page web app which allows the users to track the stats of corona virus from all over the world.
I have used HTML5, CSS3 and JAVVASCRIPT to build this web app.

This is a tracker to  track the stats(total cases, recovered, deaths) related to corona virus all over the world.
Click on the change link, it will open a scroll menu to chose from different countries.
Graphical representation is also added for better visualisation.
